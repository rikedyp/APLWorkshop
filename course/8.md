We sure have made a lot of functions so far. There seem to be a few variables in our workspace as well. We should save them somewhere for later.

### What's a workspace?
If you have been using Dyalog, the *session log* is the page with all of your input and output so far. You can scroll up the session log (with a mouse or using the `Page Up` key) and see everything you have done so far).

A workspace is a collection of names. We can obtain some lists of names using <a target="_blank" href="http://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/System%20Commands/Introduction.htm?Highlight=System%20commands">**system commands**</a>.

- Functions

```APL
	  )fns    ⍝ Functions
	  )vars   ⍝ Variables (arrays)	  
```

These commands have the special `)COMMAND` syntax, and are only used when interacting with the session. They return no result and cannot be used programmatically; they cannot be used in a function.

### System Functions
The *session* is sometimes used to refer to the interactive mode of operation (AKA *calculator mode* AKA *immediate execution mode*), in contrast to *under program control*, which is when something happens as the result of a line in a program/function. 

For example:

```APL
      myvar ← 2×⍳3   ⍝ Declare a variable in the session
      )erase myvar   ⍝ Use a system command to erase the variable
```

If we try to use a system command inside a function, it won't work.

```APL
      ]dinput        ⍝ The ]DInput user command lets us write mult-line dfns in the session
                     ⍝ Alternatively, press Shift+Enter with the cursor | on a name
      multifn←{
        ⍝ These statements are executed "under program control"
        ⎕←5+5
        var ← 2+2    ⍝ This variable only exists when this function is running
        )erase var   ⍝ This won't work
      }
```

**System functions** are functions of the form `⎕FUNCTION` and *do* return a result. Some have shy results which can be used by subsequent functions, or printed to the session output with `⎕←`.

```APL
 multifn←{
    ⍝ These statements are executed "under program control"
    ⎕←5+5
    var ← 2+2    ⍝ This variable only exists when this function is running
    ⎕EX var      ⍝ This will work
}
```

The Name List `⎕NL` function lists names.

```APL
	  ⎕NL 2    ⍝ List variables as a text matrix
	  ⎕NL 3    ⍝ List functions
	  ⎕NL-⍳9   ⍝ List all names as a nested vector of character vectors
```

### Namespaces
If nested arrays are arrays inside arrays; **namespaces** are a bit like a workspace within a workspace. They are **objects** which contain collections of names, and these names can be listed as before, but using the dot `.` syntax from <a target="_blank" href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/89031/what-is-the-origin-of-dot-notation">object-oriented</a> programming.

```APL
      )ns ns         ⍝ Create an empty namespace called ns
      ns.var←1 2 3   ⍝ Create a variable in ns called var
      ns.fn←{⍺,⍵}    ⍝ Create a function in ns called fn
      ⎕nl-9  	     ⍝ List the names of objects in the current namespace
┌──┐
│ns│
└──┘
      ns.⎕nl-⍳9      ⍝ List all names in ns
┌──┬───┐
│fn│var│
└──┴───┘
      )cs ns         ⍝ Change into ns
      ⎕this.⎕nl-⍳9   ⍝ The current namespace is ⎕THIS
┌──┬───┐
│fn│var│
└──┴───┘
      #.⎕nl-⍳9       ⍝ The root namespace is #
┌──┐
│ns│
└──┘
```

### Mutable Objects
Variables are pass-by-value. This means that if one name is used to assign another name, changes to the first name are not reflected in the second name.

```APL
      var1←1 2 3
      var2←var1     ⍝ The value of var1 is assigned to var2
      var1←var1+6   ⍝ The value of var2 is changed
      ⎕←var2          ⍝ var2 retains the previous value
1 2 3
```

Namespaces are objects and are pass-by-reference. All names which are assigned a reference can be used to refer to the original object.

```APL
      )ns ns1
#.ns1
      ns1.name←'Bob'
      ns2←ns1
      ns2.name←'Steve'
      ⎕←ns1.name
Steve
```

### Saving and Loading
There is one more type of system-thing to mention, although you have seen the `]box` one before. Commands which begin with a right-square-bracket `]` are called <a target="_blank" href="">User Commands</a>. These are also only used while interacting with the session, but you can customise them and create your own.

Dyalog webinar: <a target="_blank" href="https://dyalog.tv/Webinar/?v=LWJzRGrOC3k">Creating and Managing your own User Commands</a>

The example below shows how to save and load a workspace.

```APL
	  ]cd /tmp
	  )save MyFirstWS
	  )clear
	  )load MyFirstWS
```

{% include note.html content="If you have not been using Dyalog, you should <a href='https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm'>download and install</a> it now. From now on we begin to deal with aspects of the session and interactions with the file system and other external systems which might not be possible to without a local installation of Dyalog."%}

# Tasks

1. In terms of array rank, what type of array is a namespace?
1. What is the rank of `⎕NL x` for any scalar or vector `x`?
1. What is the rank of `⎕NL -x` for any scalar or vector `x`?
1. Save Your Work
	1. Use `]cd` to change to a directory on your machine where you would like to save your work
	1. Use `)wsid WSName` to change the name of your active workspace
	1. Use `)save` to save your workspace
	1. Use `)clear` to clear your workspace
	1. Create a new namespace called 'Day1'
	1. Use `Day1.⎕CY'WSName'` to copy the contents of your saved workspace into the `Day1` namespace
	1. Now `)save` again

  {% include note.html content="<code class='language-APL'>⎕SAVE</code> will overwrite any existing workspace file without asking first. Use <code class='language-APL'>)SAVE</code> when saving workspaces." %}
