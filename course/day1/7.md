We sure have made a lot of functions so far. There seem to be a few variables in our workspace as well. It would be nice if we could save them somewhere and keep them for later?

### What's a workspace?
If you have been using Dyalog, the session log is the page with all of your input and output so far. 

A workspace is a collection of names. We can obtain some lists of names using <a target="_blank" href="http://help.dyalog.com/latest/#Language/System%20Commands/Introduction.htm?Highlight=System%20commands">**system commands**</a>.

- Functions

```APL
	  )fns    ⍝ Functions
	  )vars   ⍝ Variables (arrays)	  
```

These commands have the special `)COMMAND` syntax, and are only used when interacting with the session. They have no result to be used programmatically.

### System Functions
**System functions** are functions of the form `⎕FUNCTION` and *do* return a result. Some have shy results which can be used by subsequent functions, or printed to the session output with `⎕←`.

The Name List `⎕NL` function lists names.

```APL
	  ⎕NL 2    ⍝ List variables as a text matrix
	  ⎕NL 3    ⍝ List functions
	  ⎕NL-⍳9   ⍝ List all names as a nested vector of character vectors
```

### Namespaces
Although you have seen them, we have yet to mention **nested arrays**. They will be discussed in more detail later, but for now you should know arrays with boxed display (when `]boxing` is on) are nested arrays. Non-nested arrays are called **simple arrays**.

```APL
      2 3⍴'DYALOG'        ⍝ A simple numeric matrix
DYA
LOG
      3⍴'DY' 'AL' 'OG'    ⍝ A nested vector of character vectors
┌──┬──┬──┐
│DY│AL│OG│
└──┴──┴──┘
      2 2⍴⍳4              ⍝ A simple numeric matrix
1 2
3 4
      3⍴(1 2)(3 4)(5 6)   ⍝ A nested vector of numeric vectors
┌───┬───┬───┐
│1 2│3 4│5 6│
└───┴───┴───┘
```

Nested arrays are arrays inside arrays. Namespaces are a bit like a workspace within a workspace. They are objects which contain collections of names, and these names can be listed as before, but using the dot `.` syntax from <a target="_blank" href="">object-oriented</a> programming.

```APL
```

**NOTE**
If you have not been using Dyalog, you should install it now. From now on we begin to deal with aspects of the session and interactions with the file system and other external systems which might not be possible to use without
