### Cells and Axes
From the APL Wiki: 
A <a target="_blank" href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Cell">cell</a> is a subarray which is formed by selecting a single index along some number of leading axes and the whole of each trailing axis. Cells are classified by their rank, which may be between 0 (scalars) and the array's rank (in which case the cell must be the entire array). Cells with rank k are called k-cells of an array. A major cell is a cell whose rank is one less than the entire array, or a 0-cell of a scalar. 

```APL
      ⍴cuboid←2 3∘.+3 4 5∘.×4 5 6 7
2 3 4 ← trailing (last) axis
↑
leading (first) axis
```

In the array `cuboid` defined above, there are `2` **major cells**, which are those of rank `¯1+≢⍴cuboid`.
