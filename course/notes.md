# Notes

### End of day 1
If you've made it this far, you'll probably want to install Dyalog. The APL interpreter is free for non-commercial use. 

Day 1 ends with some workspace and namespace basics
If students get to this part with time to spare, then we can do more problem solving while introducing other common mathematical constructs.

`* ⍟ ⌈ ⌊ ○`

- find the range
- cumulative interest
- trigonometry & shapes
- complex numbers

Otherwise, explore topics which arise from students' questions naturally.

### General
Learning APL can be more like learning a natural language
- Learn in the native script (no romanisation / wordification of symbolic constructs)
- Produce output from the beginning
    - Have output corrected by "native speaker" (experienced user) 
- Frequent input and exposure to model

Not every word or construct needs to be explicitly introduced before use or reference. Observing the use of words which one doesn't understand is normal at the beginning of learning a language. Often seeing the result in context is enough to at least know "what is going on". 

(12 3 4⍴(3×4)/1 10 100 1000)×a
(12⍴1 10 100 1000)×⍤0 2⊢a

> 	Rho, rho, rho of X
Always equals 1
Rho is dimension, rho rho rank.
APL is fun!

Richard M. Stallman, 1969
