### We Made It

The intent of this course is to guide a person with a high school / secondary education (or equivalent) education but not APL experience (and possibly no prior programming experience) to a point where they can:
- Read and write basic APL
- Attempt so solve a wide variety of problems using the primitives and constructs introduced here
- Use their existing knowledge to unpack unfamiliar or previously unseen expressions
- Use the available resources to learn about unfamiliar things and continue their learning

The user of this course should understand that there are often many decent, and sometimes equally good, different ways of expressing the same thought in APL. While a huge number and variety of problems can be tackled using the techniques shown so far, as your learning continues you will discover. You may even discover as yet unknown techniques.

### Community

### Activity

### Request

Currently there are common programming terms, and the material should be reviewed and edited to be more inclusive of people with less experience.

Of course there is always a trade-off between required prior knowledge and amount of material in a course. Eventually I would like to expand leftwards, and write material which may be valuable to people with even less experience. However, I suspect that specialised tutorials on intermediate APL will come before that. I intend to seek out more learning resources and list them [on the APL Wiki](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Learning_resources).
