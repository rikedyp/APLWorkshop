### Marking Tests
Way back in section 1.4 you wrote a dfn to convert test scores into letter values.

You were led to produce some function or expression similar to the following:

```APL      
      Grade←{'FDCBA'[+/⍵∘.>80 70 60 50 0]}
      Grade 95 65 92 77
```

If a human was manually grading test scores, they might take one scored paper at a time and decide on which letter grade to write by reading each score.

Procedural psuedocode:

```pseudocode
scores = [93,85,45,10,70,16,93,63,41,7,95,45,76] 
For each score in scores:
  If score is greater than 80:
    Write "A"
  Else If score is greater than 70:
    Write "B"
  Else If score is greater than 60:
    Write "C"
  Else If score is greater than 50:
    Write "D"
  Else
    Write "F"
```

1. Rewrite the `Grade` function as a **tradfn** called `Grade2` using control stuctures.

1. Rewrite the `Grade` function again as either a dfn or a tradfn called `Grade3` which uses the interval index function (dyadic `⍸`).

1. Use the `]runtime` user command to compare the computation time for each of the three grading functions.

    ```APL
          ]runtime -c "Grade 10×⍳10" "Grade2 10×⍳10" "Grade3 10×⍳10"
    ```
