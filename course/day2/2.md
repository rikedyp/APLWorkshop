### What's in a Name?

Study the following expression. It contains an error guard. 

```APL      
      vn←({2 6::0 ⋄ ⍎(⎕UCS ⍵),'←',⍕⍵}¨⍳1E4)~0   ⍝ Valid Naming Character Codes
```

1. Which two errors are trapped by the error guard? 

1. `⎕AV` is the list of 
   Which valid naming characters are 

1. When are digits `⎕D` not allowed in names?

1. Why is `9109 9054` printed to the session when the expression is run?

### Selecting from Arrays

```APL
      codes←'ACDDC'
      salaries←18250 42500 56000 57250 48640 
      t←4 4⍴'some sample text'
      t[⍸t∊'aeiou']←'!'
```

### Selective Assignment

((15=+/m)⌿m)←2 2⍴0 15
n←5 5⍴⍳25

1. Find at least four different ways as you can to set the bottom-right 3 by 3 submatrix in `n` to `0`.
   For example, `(2 2↓n)←0`.

### Modified Assignment

```APL
      salaries←
      codes←
      a←⎕A
      (3↑a),←'abcd'

```
(3↑⎕A)
salaries[⍸codes='C']×←1.05
n←⍳10
((2|n)/n)

m←5 2⍴6 1 3 3 10 5 1 10 6 9

n←5 5⍴⍳25

### At

Monadic functions take a single right argument array as input. Dyadic functions take two argument arrays.

Monadic operators take a single left operand which can be a function or an array (as in `+/`). Dyadic operators take two operands which could be functions or arrays depending on the operator's definition.

Selective and indexed assignment methods will change the values of variables. The "at" operator `@` merges two arrays at specific indices.

If a function right operand. returns a boolean array when applied to `⍵` (e.g. `3=1 3 5`) then `1`s in the boolean array determine where scalars of `⍺` are inserted.

```APL
      ('∆⍥'@{⍵∊'AEIOU'})2 3⍴'DYALOG'
      ('∆⍥'@1)2 3⍴'DYALOG'
      (' '@2 3 4)'DYALOG'
      (' '@(1 2)(1 3)(2 1))2 3⍴'DYALOG'
```

Generally, the left operand to `@` is 

```APL
      {1↓(1∘⎕C@{¯1⌽' '=⍵})' ',⍵}'my excellent heading'
```

### Strand Assignment

```APL
      (max min avg)←{(⌈⌿⍵)(⌊⌿⍵)((+⌿÷≢)⍵)}3 1 4 1 5
```
