### Error Messages and Error Codes

You will have executed expressions which have resulted in some error messages by now. In fact I am certain of it because some of the previous example expressions have been deliberately written containing errors.

`LENGTH ERROR` `VALUE ERROR` `DOMAIN ERROR` `SYNTAX ERROR`

The system function `⎕EM` returns error messages for integer error codes. 

1. Find the error codes of the four error messages given above.

{% include hint.html id="errorcodes" content="Search for the indices of error messages in the nested vector of character vectors given by <code class='language-APL'>⎕EM ⍳99</code>" %}

### Hop on the Stack
For the purpose of a brief introduction, if you call a function then that function goes on *the execution stack*. If a function 

The *state indicator* `⎕SI` is a nested vector of character vectors of the names of functions on the stack. 

Define the functions `Start`, `InFn` and `OutFn` in your 'Day2' namespace.

```APL
      a
```
