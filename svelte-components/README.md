# Svelte + Jekyll + Carbon Design System

**NOTE:** This is an in-progress extension to the APLWorkshop "system."

[Svelte]() and [Carbon]() are used in conjunction with [Jekyll]() and [GitHub Pages]() to create interactive APL learning materials that are consistent across devices.

At present, the only part of this repository utilizing this framework are the [cheatsheets](../cheatsheets/).
